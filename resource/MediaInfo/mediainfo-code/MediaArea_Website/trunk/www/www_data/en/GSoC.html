<h2 id="AboutUs">About us</h2>
<p>
MediaArea is a software development and technical consulting company based in France with a focus on audiovisual analysis. From its beginning MediaArea has established itself as an open source company throughout, working with partners to produce Free Software to address technical audiovisual challenges and requirements. MediaArea’s focus on technical audiovisual metadata has led to a number of collaborations with archives and broadcasters which need to properly identify and assess digital media for proper quality control and informed decision making. Key MediaArea projects have included: QCTools, BWF MetaEdit and Preforma.
</p>

<p>
MediaArea is best known for its centerpiece project, MediaInfo. MediaInfo is a cross-platform, Free Open-Source Software (“FOSS”) application that analyzes digital files, reporting on a number of technical characteristics in the form of metadata, or ‘data about data.’ Focusing on digital audiovisual media, MediaInfo has been a significant asset for several projects ranging from enterprise-class media applications to open repository systems.
</p>

<p>
As the founder of MediaArea, Jérôme Martinez, manages MediaInfo and other MediaArea projects in a manner responsive to the complex needs of the archive and media communities.
</p>

<h2 id="Why">Why are we applying to GSoC?</h2>
<p>
Through working in a diverse set of media-focused software development projects, MediaArea has been recently comtemplating several findings. Firstly, operating as a contributing member of a larger open source community is increasingly essential and beneficial to all. Addtionally, although there is an abundance of coders there is a real lack of productive, focused learning opportunities. The annoucement of GSoC projects always peaks our interest to discover how GSoC is addressing technical challenges, media-focused or otherwise, through a mentorship model as well as how the results contribute to our partners or challenges we are involved in. MediaArea has recently been undergrowing growth while maintaining its central open source and community-focused principles. It’s always been envisioned to someday participate in the GSoC project and we feel confident that this is the year to get involved.
</p>

<p>
By seeking to participate in GSoC, we are presenting several projects which we believe will be useful both to the communities that we seek to serve, GSoC students, and MediaArea itself. Because much of our work is focused on the non-profit sector, such as archives, media centers, and memory institutions, we frequently envision projects and solutions that are challenging to align with funding opportunities. Because of the size, scope, and spirit of the GSoC program we hope to use some of these practical opportunities for the benefits of such communities.
</p>

<h2 id="License">Which license?</h2>
<p>
Whenever possible MediaArea uses a BSD 2-Clause license. This is to enable users a fairly unrestricted level of creativity to reuse or implement our work in a variety of solutions, both open source and commercial.

<h2 id="FFV1">FFV1 parser</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
FFV1 is a digital lossless video format. We believe that this open format is at a tipping point in regards to its relevant and suitability for work in audiovisual preservation roles. As decades of analog video collections face increasing challenges of deterioration and technical obsolence, it is imperative to enable archives with better abilities and options for digitizing such material sooner rather than later. Standard-based preservation practices mandate a lossless encoding in these efforts and we want to support FFV1&rsquo;s increasing relevance and role in addressing this challenge.<br/>
To better support the archival use of FFV1 we need to parse more deeply the FFV1 bitstream to identify conformance or coherency issues while there is time to address them. Unfortunately, the specification is under development and relies strongly on the reference encoder for clarity.
</p>
<h3>Deliverable</h3>
<p>
To provide a means to generate a comprehensive trace of the FFV1 bitstream, partial (begin of the bitstream) or complete depending of the difficulty detected during the implementation. The output shall be suitable to reveal the architecture of FFV1 bitstreams and support analytical, quality control, and conformance checks of the format.</p>

<h2 id="Matroska">Matroska/WebM parser</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
