MediaInfo change log:

Version 0.7.79, 2015-11-02
--------------
+ CLI/DLL only, XML: new option --Output=MIXML, with XML v2.0beta1 status, not for production, see https://github.com/MediaArea/MediaAreaXml for more details
+ MediaTrace: support of more than 1 file in XML output.
+ CLI/DLL only, XML: new option --Output=MAXML, with XML v0.1 status, in order to have bot MediaInfo and MediaTrace in the same output, not for production, see https://github.com/MediaArea/MediaAreaXml for more details
x MediaTrace: fixed some invalid outputs
x #B951, Amazon S3 support (REST API v2), CLI/DLL only and if compiled with libcurl support: URL without credential were badly interpreted

Version 0.7.78, 2015-10-02
--------------
+ MOV: AVrp CodecID support
+ Video Stored_Width/Stored_Height and Sampled_Width/Sampled_Height added (hidden by default)
+ Speed optimization for the parsing of tiny files e.g. JPEG files
+ Option (command line / DLL) --Legacy=0 for disabling some legacy fields
+ Option (command line / DLL) --Output=MAXML, XML with MediaInfo and MediaTrace output together, technology preview (not for production)
x MPEG-TS: Teletext and Teletext Subtitle were missing in the menu list
x Chroma subsampling "4:4:4" was sometimes indicated for RGB, which is not useful

Version 0.7.77, 2015-09-02
--------------
+ #B941, MXF: files having only a video stream and an ancillary data stream were having incorrect second video stream
+ MOV: detection of r210 CodecID as raw RGB
+ Ancillary data: detection of all metadata blocks (previously: only the first one was detected)
x MPEG-TS: Wrong demux of TSP (188+16 TS) files having PES with only padding
x MediaTrace #2: XML malformed with Flags items (hotfix, flags meaning disabled in XML output)
x MediaTrace #3: XML malformed with some MP4 files
x MediaTrace #6: XML duplicated attributes
x MediaTrace #10: versioned xsd, creating library name and version
x MediaTrace: XML content was not escaped
x #B947, Amazon S3 support (REST API v2), CLI/DLL only and if compiled with libcurl support: Analyze file on s3 was not working if secret key contains / character

Version 0.7.76, 2015-08-06
--------------
+ XML output: line breaks and indents in between attributes for readability
+ Trace feature: XML trace update, only if compiled with trace feature
+ Amazon S3 support (REST API v2), CLI/DLL only and if compiled with libcurl support
+ FFV1: improved slice analysis (currently activated only with trace feature and for 1st frame)
x MXF: optimization of the parsing, reading a lot less data (e.g. can be reduced from 1 GB to 10 MB with some UHD files)
x MXF: wrong frame count with files not having the video stream as the first stream
x Dolby E in MPEG-TS: "SMPTE ST 302" information was accidentally removed
x MPEG-TS: avoid filling delay from file name, not applicable on MPEG-TS
x MXF: better handling of huge padding blocks, better handling of descriptors without link to a TrackID
x IMX: streams claiming that they are IMX are actually pure MPEG Video, probing both IMX and MPEG Video

Version 0.7.75, 2015-06-30
--------------
+ MXF: consideraing 60 fps timecode tracks with 2 components having a difference of 2 frames as a single timecode
+ EBUCore 1.6: switch to the link of the final XSD
x XDCAM: some directory structures were wrongly detected as XDCAM structure having a XML file
x MXF: SDTI 60 fps times were wrong
x #B927, DPX: date/time specific DPX format was used instead of the ISO-like one
x #B927, EBUCore: invalid content in attribute startDate
x ProRes: streams with apcs CodecID were displayed with an incoherent bit depth instead of no bit depth

Version 0.7.74, 2015-05-25
--------------
+ FIMS: Preliminary version (not for production)
+ D-10 audio: display of real bitrate beside the encoded bitrate
+ VC-3: detection of CDP packets (608/708 captions), created by Nexio, inside the VC-3 private data
+ AES3: generic term AES3 replaced by more precise SMPTE ST numbers (302, 331, 337)
+ NUT: basic detection
+ FFV1: more parsing of the bitstream, support of any version of FFV1 in MOV and Matroska
+ DPX: color space and frame rate
x #B906, Matroska: duration was missing if Info block is at the end of the file
x #B908, AC-3: bit depth removed
x #P86, MPEG-4: moov_trak_edts_elst Atom was ignoring version of the atom
x Dolby E: the MXF channel count value was sometimes reported instead of the real channel count
x VorbisComment: WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE_CHANNEL_MASK "0X" ("x" in uppercase) is accepted now
x EBUCore: TotalProgrammeDuration was wrongly filled with IdentClockStart value
x EBUCore: Source/Material moved from timecodeStart to timecodeTrack
x MPEG-4: info is missing for some streams in some specific cases
